🎬 Scene Recognition: AI-Powered Image Understanding 🚀
🔍 What is it?
Scene Recognition uses deep learning to classify and understand images! With cutting-edge models like Vision Transformers (ViT), this project enables AI to categorize scenes—whether urban, nature, or indoors. Perfect for robotics, autonomous systems, or media tagging!

🌟 Key Features
AI-Powered Scene Classification: Classify scenes like a pro with deep learning.

Real-Time Predictions: Instant image categorization for applications like smart devices.

Flexible Training: Fine-tune the model for your own dataset.

⚡ Quick Start
1. Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/ar040701/Scene-Recognition.git
cd Scene-Recognition

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Train Your Model
python train.py --data_path <your_data_path> --epochs <num_epochs> --batch_size <batch_size>

4. Run Inference
python infer.py --image_path <image_to_classify>

🤖 Model Details
This project uses Vision Transformers (ViT) and CNNs for high-accuracy image classification. ViT revolutionizes image understanding with attention mechanisms, making it more powerful than traditional models!
